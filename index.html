      It takes nearly a year for a cherry to mature after first flowering, and
      about 5 years of growth to reach full fruit production. While coffee
      plants can live up to 100 years, they are generally the most productive
      between the ages of 7 and 20. Proper care can maintain and even increase
      their output over the years, depending on the variety. The average coffee
      tree produces 10 pounds of coffee cherry per year, or 2 pounds of green
      beans.
